# CLI-Based-File-Manager
This is the project I created when I was giving class 12th boards. Simultaneously exams going on and also this project. A CLI based File Manager that can create/list/rename/delete files in cwd (current working directory). You can write into a file, read from a file and also empty a file (use with caution).  File supports - .txt, .dat and .csv
